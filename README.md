# Ocular

Ocular is a state-of-the-art historical OCR system.

Its primary features are:

* Unsupervised learning of unknown fonts: requires only document images and a corpus of text.
* Ability to handle noisy documents: inconsistent inking, spacing, vertical alignment, etc.
* Support for multilingual documents, including those that have considerable word-level code-switching.
* Unsupervised learning of orthographic variation patterns including archaic spellings and printer shorthand.
* Simultaneous, joint transcription into both diplomatic (literal) and normalized forms, the first OCR system of its kind.

It is described in the following publications:

## 1. Quick-Start Guide

### Obtaining Ocular

The easiest way to get the Ocular software is to download the self-contained jar from http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dhg/maven-repository/snapshots/edu/berkeley/cs/nlp/ocular/0.3-SNAPSHOT/ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar

Once you have this jar, you will be able to run Ocular according to the instructions below in the [Using Ocular](#using-ocular) section; the code in this repository is not a requirement if all you'd like to do is run the software.

The jar is executable, so when you use go to use Ocular, you will run it following this template (where [MAIN-CLASS] will specify which program to run, as detailed in the [Using Ocular](#using-ocular) section below):

    java -Done-jar.main.class=[MAIN-CLASS] -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar [options...]

This jar includes all the necessary dependencies, so you should be able to move it to, and run it from, wherever you like.


#### Optional: Building Ocular from source code

Clone this repository, and compile the project into a jar:

    git clone https://github.com/tberg12/ocular.git
    cd ocular
    ./make_jar.sh

This creates precisely the same `ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar` jar file discussed above.  Thus, this is sufficient to be able to run Ocular, as stated above, using the detailed instructions in the [Using Ocular](#using-ocular) section below.

Also like above, since this jar includes all the necessary dependencies, so you should be able to move it wherever you like, without the rest of the contents of this repository.

**Compiling to an executable script instead of jar**

Alternatively, if you do not wish to create the entire jar, you can run `make_run_script.sh`, which compiles the code and generates an executable script `target/start`.  This script can be used directly, in lieu of the jar file.  Thus to run Ocular, it is sufficient to run the `make_run_script.sh` script and then use the following template instead of the template given above:
  
    export JAVA_OPTS="-mx7g"     # Increase the available memory
    target/start [MAIN-CLASS] [options...]

#### Optional: Obtaining Ocular via a dependency management system

  To incorporate Ocular into a larger project, you may use a dependency management system like Maven or SBT with the following information:

    * Repository location: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dhg/maven-repository/snapshots
    * Group ID: edu.berkeley.cs.nlp
    * Artifact ID: ocular
    * Version: 0.3-SNAPSHOT
    



### Using Ocular

1. Initialize a language model:

  Acquire some files with text written in the language(s) of your documents. For example, download a book in [English](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt). The path specified by `-inputTextPath` should point to a text file or directory or directory hierarchy of text files; the path will be searched recursively for files.  Use `-outputLmPath` to specify where the trained LM should be written.

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.InitializeLanguageModel -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputTextPath texts/pg2600.txt \
        -outputLmPath lm/english.lmser

  For a multilingual (code-switching) model, specify multiple `-inputTextPath` entries composed of a language name and a path to files containing text in that language.  For example, a combined [Spanish](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2000/pg2000.txt)/[Latin](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/23306/pg23306.txt)/[Nahuatl](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12219/pg12219.txt) might be trained as follows:

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.InitializeLanguageModel -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputTextPath "spanish->texts/sp/,latin->texts/la/,nahuatl->texts/na/" \
        -outputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser

  This program will work with any languages, and any number of languages; simply add an entry for every relevant language.  The set of languages chosen should match the set of languages found in the documents that are to be transcribed.

  More details on the various command-line options can be found below.


2. Initialize a font:

  Before a font can be trained from texts, a font model consisting of a "guess" for each character must be initialized based on the fonts on your computer.  Use `-outputFontPath` to specify where the initialized font should be written.  Since different languages use different character sets, a language model must be given in order for the system to know what characters to initialize (`-inputLmPath`).

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.InitializeFont -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser \
        -outputFontPath font/trilingual-init.fontser


3. Train a font:

  To train a font, a set of document pages must be given (`-inputDocPath`), along with the paths to the language model and initial font model.  Use `-outputFontPath` to specify where the trained font model should be written, and `-outputPath` to specify where transcriptions and (optional) evaluation metrics should be written.  The path specified by `-inputDocPath` should point to a pdf or image file or directory or directory hierarchy of such files.  The value given by `-inputDocPath` will be searched recursively for non-`.txt` files; the transcriptions written to the `-outputPath` will maintain the same directory hierarchy.

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.TrainFont -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputFontPath font/trilingual-init.fontser \
        -inputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser \
        -inputDocPath sample_images/advertencias \
        -numDocs 10 \
        -outputFontPath font/advertencias/trained.fontser \
        -outputPath train_output

  Since the operation of the font trainer is to take in a font model (`-inputFontPath`) and output a new and improved font model (`-outputFontPath`), TrainFont can be run multiple times, passing the output back in as the input of the next round, to continue to making improvements.
    
  Many more command-line options, including several that affect speed and accuracy, can be found below.

  **Optional: Glyph substitution modeling for variable orthography**
  
  Ocular has the optional ability to learn, unsupervised, a mapping from archaic orthography to the orthography reflected in the trained language model. We call this a "glyph substitution model" (GSM).  To train a GSM, add the `-allowGlyphSubstitution`, `-updateGsm` and `-outputGsmPath` options.  If no `-inputGsmPath` is given, a new GSM will be created and then trained along with the font.

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.TrainFont -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputFontPath font/trilingual-init.fontser \
        -inputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser \
        -inputDocPath sample_images/advertencias \
        -numDocs 10 \
        -outputFontPath font/advertencias/trained.fontser \
        -outputPath train_output \
        -allowGlyphSubstitution true \
        -updateGsm true \
        -outputGsmPath gsm/advertencias/trained.gsmser

  If `-allowGlyphSubstitution` is set to true, Ocular will produce simultaneous dual transcriptions: one *diplomatic* (literal) and one normalized to match the LM training data's orthography.


4. Transcribe some pages:

  To transcribe pages, `-inputFontPath` should point to the newly-trained font model (the `-outputFontPath` from the training step, instead of the "initial" font model used during font training).

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.Transcribe -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputDocPath sample_images/advertencias \
        -inputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser \
        -inputFontPath font/advertencias/trained.fontser \
        -outputPath transcribe_output 

  As above, if `-allowGlyphSubstitution` is set to true and the `-inputGsmPath` is given, Ocular will produce simultaneous dual transcriptions: one *diplomatic* (literal) and one normalized to match the LM training data's orthography.

  Many more command-line options, including several that affect speed and accuracy, can be found below.  Among these, `-skipAlreadyTranscribedDocs` might be particularly useful.
  
  **Optional: Continued model improvements during transcription**
  
  Since training is a model is done in an unsupervised fashion (it requires no gold transcriptions), the operation of transcribing is actually a subset of EM font training.  Because of this, it is possible make further improvements to the models during transcription, without having to make multiple iterations over the documents.  This can be done by setting `-updateFont` to `true`, and `-updateDocBatchSize` to a reasonable number of training documents:

      java -Done-jar.main.class=edu.berkeley.cs.nlp.ocular.main.Transcribe -mx7g -jar ocular-0.3-SNAPSHOT-with_dependencies.jar \
        -inputDocPath sample_images/advertencias \
        -inputLmPath lm/trilingual.lmser \
        -inputFontPath font/advertencias/trained.fontser \
        -outputPath transcribe_output \
        -updateFont true \
        -updateDocBatchSize 50 \
        -outputFontPath font/advertencias/trained.fontser
      
  The same can be done to update the glyph substitution model by passing in the previously-trained model (`-inputGsmPath`) and setting `-updateGsm` to `true`.

        -allowGlyphSubstitution true \
        -inputGsmPath gsm/advertencias/trained.gsmser \
        -updateGsm true \
        -outputGsmPath gsm/advertencias/trained.gsmser
  
  **Optional: Checking accuracy with a gold transcription**

  If a gold standard transcription is available for a file, it should be written in a `.txt` file in the same directory as the corresponding image, and given the same filename (but with a different extension).  These files will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the transcription (during either training or testing).  Likewise, if a gold normalized transcription is available, it should be given the same filename, but with `_normalized` appended.  For example:

      path/to/some/image_001.jpg              # document image
      path/to/some/image_001.txt              # corresponding transcription
      path/to/some/image_001_normalized.txt   # corresponding normalized transcription

  For pdf files, the transcription filename is based on both the pdf filename and the relevant page number (as a 5-digit number):

      path/to/some/filename.pdf                            # document image
      path/to/some/filename_pdf_page00001.txt              # transcription of the document's first page
      path/to/some/filename_pdf_page00001_normalized.txt   # corresponding normalized transcription

Default: false

##### Glyph Substitution Model Options

Glyph substitution is the feature that allows Ocular to use a probabilistic mapping from modern orthography (as used in the language model training text) to the orthography seen in the documents. If the glyph substitution feature is used, Ocular will jointly produce dual transcriptions: one that is an exact transcription of the document, and one that is a normalized version of the text.

* `-crop`:
Crop pages?
Default: true

##### Evaluate During Training

* `-evalInputDocPath`:
When evaluation should be done during training (after each parameter update in EM), this is the path of the directory that contains the evaluation input document images. The entire directory will be recursively searched for any files that do not end in `.txt` (and that do not start with `.`). (Only relevant if updateFont is set to true.)
Default: Do not evaluate during font training.

* `-evalNumDocs`:
When using -evalInputDocPath, this is the number of documents that will be evaluated on. Ignore or use 0 to use all documents.
Default: Use all documents in the specified path.

* `-evalExtractedLinesPath`:
When using -evalInputDocPath, this is the path of the directory where the evaluation line-extraction images should be read/written.  If the line files exist here, they will be used; if not, they will be extracted and then written here.  Useful if: 1) you plan to run Ocular on the same documents multiple times and you want to save some time by not re-extracting the lines, or 2) you use an alternate line extractor (such as Tesseract) to pre-process the document.  If ignored, the document will simply be read from the original document image file, and no line images will be written.

##### Glyph Substitution Model Options

Glyph substitution is the feature that allows Ocular to use a probabilistic mapping from modern orthography (as used in the language model training text) to the orthography seen in the documents. If the glyph substitution feature is used, Ocular will jointly produce dual transcriptions: one that is an exact transcription of the document, and one that is a normalized version of the text.

* `-allowGlyphSubstitution`:
Should the model allow glyph substitutions? This includes substituted letters as well as letter elisions.
Default: false

* `-inputGsmPath`:
Path to the input glyph substitution model file. (Only relevant if allowGlyphSubstitution is set to true.)
Default: Don't use a pre-initialized GSM. (Learn one from scratch).

##### Model Updating Options

* `-updateDocBatchSize`:
Number of documents to process for each parameter update.  This is useful if you are transcribing a large number of documents, and want to have Ocular slowly improve the model as it goes, which you would achieve with updateFont=true.
Default: Update only after each full pass over the document set.

For updating the font model

* `-updateFont`:
Update the font during transcription based on the new input documents?
Default: false

* `-outputFontPath`:
Path to write the learned font file to.
Required if updateFont is set to true, otherwise ignored.

For updating the glyph substitution model

* `-updateGsm`:
Should the glyph substitution model be trained (or updated) along with the font? (Only relevant if allowGlyphSubstitution is set to true.)
Default: false

* `-outputGsmPath`:
Path to write the retrained glyph substitution model file to.
Required if updateGsm is set to true, otherwise ignored.

For updating the language model

* `-updateLM`:
Should the language model be updated along with the font?
Default: false

* `-outputLmPath`:
Path to write the retrained language model file to.
Required if updateLM is set to true, otherwise ignored.

##### Line Extraction Options

* `-binarizeThreshold`:
Quantile to use for pixel value thresholding. (High values mean more black pixels.)
Default: 0.12

* `-crop`:
Crop pages?
Default: true

##### Evaluate During Training

* `-evalInputDocPath`:
When evaluation should be done during training (after each parameter update in EM), this is the path of the directory that contains the evaluation input document images. The entire directory will be recursively searched for any files that do not end in `.txt` (and that do not start with `.`). (Only relevant if updateFont is set to true.)
Default: Do not evaluate during font training.

* `-evalNumDocs`:
When using -evalInputDocPath, this is the number of documents that will be evaluated on. Ignore or use 0 to use all documents.
Default: Use all documents in the specified path.

* `-evalBatches`:
When using -evalInputDocPath, on iterations in which we run the evaluation, should the evaluation be run after each batch, as determined by -updateDocBatchSize (in addition to after each iteration)?
Default: false

* `-evalExtractedLinesPath`:
When using -evalInputDocPath, this is the path of the directory where the evaluation line-extraction images should be read/written.  If the line files exist here, they will be used; if not, they will be extracted and then written here.  Useful if: 1) you plan to run Ocular on the same documents multiple times and you want to save some time by not re-extracting the lines, or 2) you use an alternate line extractor (such as Tesseract) to pre-process the document.  If ignored, the document will simply be read from the original document image file, and no line images will be written.
Default: Don't read or write line image files.

##### Rarely Used Options

* `-allowLanguageSwitchOnPunct`:
A language model to be used to assign diacritics to the transcription output.
Default: true

* `-cudaDeviceID`:
GPU ID when using CUDA emission engine.
Default: 0

* `-decodeBatchSize`:
Number of lines that compose a single decode batch. (Smaller batch size can reduce memory consumption.)
Default: 32

* `-gsmElideAnything`:
Should the GSM be allowed to elide letters even without the presence of an elision-marking tilde?
Default: false

* `-gsmElisionSmoothingCountMultiplier`:
gsmElisionSmoothingCountMultiplier.
Default: 100.0

* `-gsmNoCharSubPrior`:
The prior probability of not-substituting the LM char. This includes substituted letters as well as letter elisions.
Default: 0.9

* `-gsmPower`:
Exponent on GSM scores.
Default: 4.0

* `-gsmSmoothingCount`:
The default number of counts that every glyph gets in order to smooth the glyph substitution model estimation.
Default: 1.0

* `-paddingMaxWidth`:
Max horizontal padding between characters in pixels (Best left at default value.)
Default: 5

* `-paddingMinWidth`:
Min horizontal padding between characters in pixels. (Best left at default value.)
Default: 1

* `-uniformLineHeight`:
Scale all lines to have the same height?
Default: true

* `-numDecodeThreads`:
Number of threads to use for decoding. (More thread may increase speed, but may cause a loss of continuity across lines.)
Default: 1

* `-numEmissionCacheThreads`:
Number of threads to use during emission cache computation. (Only has effect when emissionEngine is set to DEFAULT.)
Default: 8

* `-numMstepThreads`:
Number of threads to use for LFBGS during m-step.
Default: 8
